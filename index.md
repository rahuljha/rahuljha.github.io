I am an applied scientist at Microsoft working on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning problems. I've worked on ads relevance ranking (Bing), dialog and language understanding (Cortana) and document summarization (Office365). 

Before Microsoft, I got my PhD from University of Michigan in 2015 working under Prof. Dragomir Radev ([now at Yale](https://yale-lily.github.io/)). My thesis work focussed on automatic survey generation of scientific topics.

Find a complete list of my publications [here](/publications/). I occassionaly blog about topics I am interested in, you can find them below.
