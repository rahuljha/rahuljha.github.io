I am an applied scientist at Microsoft working on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning problems. The products I've worked with include Bing Ads and Cortana. I got my PhD from University of Michigan in 2015 working under Prof. Dragomir Radev ([now at Yale](https://yale-lily.github.io/)). My thesis work focussed on automatic survey generation of scientific topics.
