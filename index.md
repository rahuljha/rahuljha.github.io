I am a research scientist at Netflix in the Search & Recommendations team working on conversational and interactive recommendations. Previously, I was an applied science tech-lead at Microsoft working on recommendation, ranking, & NLP problems including ads relevance ranking, dialog and language understanding, document summarization and content recommendation.

I got my PhD from University of Michigan in 2015 working under Prof. Dragomir Radev ([now at Yale](https://yale-lily.github.io/)). My thesis work focussed on automatic survey generation of scientific topics.

Find a complete list of my publications [here](/publications/). I occassionaly blog about topics I am interested in, you can find them below.
